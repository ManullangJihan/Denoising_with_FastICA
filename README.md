# FastICA

FastICA seeks an orthogonal rotation of prewhitened data through a fixed-point iteration scheme, that maximizes a measure of non-Gaussianity of the rotated components.

The Algorithm that used in this study can be divide by:
1. Pre-processing data that consist of two techniques. a) centering the data and b)normalize the data to -1 and 1.
2. Whitening process
3. Apply FastICA using maximum negative entropy
4. Calculate MSE and RMSE 
5. Visualize the results
